Beth Azzopardi: yes, I'm recording it and…
Alphonso Varela: products
Beth Azzopardi: So I let you tell me when you finish Give Me A Sign.
Ivan Gonzalez: Instagram Never let me know skimmed them.
Beth Azzopardi: Okay, so there's all key actions that came from it were we had quite a lengthy discussion about so the shape of the projects and so to options were to do two six week projects or to do three week projects. I think we've all decided. We're not going to continue doing sick six weeks or one week projects. and then Sean and I Have come up with a sort of rough. Draft of full three week projects and I believe Nick can Alphonso have done the same for two six week projects. so I suppose what we could do is just talk you through what we did what we prepared.
Ivan Gonzalez: Sounds good.
Beth Azzopardi: Okay, Alphonso. Do you have a preference going first or second?
Alphonso Varela: I don't mind I can go first. It's quite short notes. I've got it on
Alphonso Varela: in the same places the other ones by the time we're done here, So it is quite short. It's a bit vague. So Nick and I were flirting with the idea of longer projects.
Ivan Gonzalez: problems
Alphonso Varela: If you remember from the last meeting. We were thinking of maybe two six week projects or
Alphonso Varela: Yeah to six week projects was what we were looking more at and so looking around it actually seems like there's a small trend of companies actually moving towards.
Ivan Gonzalez: complete
Alphonso Varela: in scrum moving towards six week sprinting
Alphonso Varela: Which seems to be kind of taking off in some places…
Ivan Gonzalez: give me
Alphonso Varela: where they do six week. Sprints and then have two week cool down periods.
Alphonso Varela: But the bigger challenge that we were talking specifically about incorporating other languages.
Ivan Gonzalez: .
Alphonso Varela: How are we going to expose them to whatnet and all of that? and it's a bit complicated without having a specific plan of what they would build but the basic idea that is floating around in the notes is just to have Two projects of So considering each week a six Sprints of one week and in all of those and so in those it repeats the same pattern where one is one big in-house and one is a
Alphonso Varela: take for better.
Alphonso Varela: it would start off with Us introducing scrum and intro to design and some workshops and then the second week being Sprint planning and design and user testing and then three and four is just building. And then five is where we have the launch deadlines. So it's final reviews and hand over the project and on six you have retrospectives. The presentation which for the tech for better would be the Showcase and a review of the project in the portfolio. So the idea would this layout and there's a lot more notes that Nick has been adding but we didn't get a chance to go over together. So I will transcribe everything in the end.
Alphonso Varela: So the idea with this is that it gives a lot of space for the stuff that we have to deliver. So with all the talks and US delivering workshops and also leaves space for the idea of them Actually kind of like practicing writing a portfolio on each of those projects…
Ivan Gonzalez: right
Alphonso Varela: where at the end. We actually have them hand over a report of that project. And they could still build a large project. By the time to get to Tech for better they've done the whole process in large-scale once and then we can do it for the product owner and it gives a space for all the stuff that we also have to deliver as a training provider. and then I not able to talk about it in a lot of detail, but I will share the notes but Nick actually broke down
Alphonso Varela: For a project like week one setting up the environment and building backhand with Then react front end. Then adding more UI and…
Ivan Gonzalez: .
Alphonso Varela: ux and other features and then finalizing and deployment in week six and it's got a few notes for each section. He also wrote on the document that I smell bad, but I don't think that's relevant. I'm gonna share that.
00:05:00
Ivan Gonzalez: prescription
Alphonso Varela: And I'll share it here and then I will move it to the same place where Sean and Beth's one is our notion for Simplicity, but everyone can have a look at the stock in the chat if they want. So yeah, that's the basic overview and you've got the more detailed notes there. I don't know if you want to. go over to yours bets and then we'll review everything.
Beth Azzopardi: Yeah, I'm just shoving it. as well
Beth Azzopardi: So all quite I don't know if it was as in debt, but something that we wanted to talk about. Kind of before we jumped into what the structure would actually look like. Was the sort of strengths and what we would be addressing by following the three-week approach versus the six week approach. And Sean very kindly actually looked through all the feedback from fact 28 and has kind of put that together. I've linked the Google Doc. I'm not sure if you'll have access to it but inside that motion document. and so before we started going over the project we Had a look at the feedback and what this?
Beth Azzopardi: Approach how it responds to the feedback. And the reason we were doing this was kind of not to necessarily advocate for the three projects, but just to have something useful to take forward if we do end up going with the six week project and kind of just make sure that if we're doing that work also addressing all these things which came up. So we kind of spoke about those.
Beth Azzopardi: how the framework that we were using address the things that came up so some of these were if we do go with the three week approach it gives us more flexibility in terms of this being a new curriculum. So we needed to change something we would have space to do that. Also a big thing that came up in terms of a big challenge that came up was people working with specific people.
Beth Azzopardi: And I guess it's something to be aware of this is if you put people in two six week projects, they're working with the same people quite a long time. also doing shorter projects kind of allow one point of learning to become the focal point essentially,…
Ivan Gonzalez: collection
Beth Azzopardi: although some people said actually shorter projects to exactly the opposite of that…
Ivan Gonzalez: 
Beth Azzopardi: because you spent so much time getting everything else in order. We also found that Learners enjoy ucing. new Concepts and exploring different roles again. If you're just doing two six week projects that's potentially only two roles and less halfway through the project we switch in roles.
Beth Azzopardi: I don't know that's a potential response to that from the six weeks side of things and also people enjoy seeing a finished project. And so I think there's a lot of value. In finishing two bigger projects I suppose. The three week projects are still much bigger than the one-week projects. and so all rough outline was the first project would be full stack. So they've already used Express and node in the boot camp. This is just a chance to build a project using react and also learn about databases because we are not covering up the moment in the part-time program. So that is basically just consolidating with the addition of react which I suppose.
Beth Azzopardi: Is quite new and also databases. Then project two. This could be an opportunity to learn sharp. .net so that's backend and then continue with react and then the project three we thought this could either be possibly an opportunity to split up the Hackney Council people so they could continue using react but also this could be an opportunity for some people to use next if they want to and then the last project was set for Bettis. We didn't really go into that because we thought that is an opportunity for Learners to choose their Tech stack. And that's a board overview. of that
00:10:00
Beth Azzopardi: Yeah.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah, I do like it. I think you're right in the sense managing. The cohort would be a bit easier with those three weeks. Where at the start you don't really know how they're gonna work together necessarily. and then to find out in the middle of a six Sprint six week project that they like a certain group doesn't go very well is very tricky.
Beth Azzopardi: Going to particularly as we're having Learners coming in who may not have done the skills boot camp / Foundation.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah. Yeah, so I think having that flexibility is really good actually in that sense.
Ivan Gonzalez: Thank you.
Ivan Gonzalez: So we're doing Dot net as well as react. Sounds like it might be kind of intense.
Alphonso Varela: I guess this is an idea that was kind of in the air There's some excitement. I like the idea. I think we're still all a bit divided on whether or not we want to do that from what I remember from last week.
Ivan Gonzalez: and I think I'm kind of like for it I do worry, it feels like overwhelming enough with just one language another being able to maybe that's fine. But
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah.
Beth Azzopardi: I think people who have come through the Are Gonna Leave the skills boot camp with more knowledge Then they have done previously or…
Alphonso Varela: and they were
Beth Azzopardi: more advanced knowledge. in terms of Express and I think quite a lot of the start of the full-time program is getting your head around that I do feel some Concern about the people who are potentially coming through hacking Council whose experience we don't know about because if they're coming in a beginner level. I don't know if this is beginner.
Dan Sofer: yeah if Hackney
Dan Sofer: nominate anyone Or accept anyone until their apprenticeship, which I hope will happen in. February then we'll put them onto our March skills boot camp. And the times don't quite match up, but we'll sort of I don't know will Fast Track them somehow, but we will give them plenty to do in the run-up look so we'll see how that goes. The already one or…
Beth Azzopardi: Okay.
Dan Sofer: two people who? Have heard about the opportunity from Hackney. And a contacting us and a likely be coming to meet ups.
Dan Sofer: So there is an issue around. People having only half finished.
Dan Sofer: A skills boot camp before the apprenticeship is due to start then maybe one or two of those. I can't imagine and we'll have to do something special for them, but I cannot imagine somebody onto the apprenticeship without a significant amount of appropship training
Beth Azzopardi: Okay.
Dan Sofer: It is officially the first accelerated apprenticeship, which means they are expected to have done some of the curriculum. So it's a reasonable expectation and that people not background zero and Hackney understand that.
Beth Azzopardi: Okay, that's definitely reassuring.
Alphonso Varela: It could also be that it's someone from us right that could also happen. Yeah.
Dan Sofer: Yep.
Beth Azzopardi: someone about I mean Ivan, I am interested that you think it's potentially quite a lot because I mean you have Been on the facilitation side of the full-time program for a lot longer. so I think It's worth considering that doing two languages. And might be very intense.
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah, that's not to say it won't work. But I reckon. it's kind of ramp up the level of the intensity which From what I hear it's already quite High.
Ivan Gonzalez: But people might take to it but this is gonna be confusing. I feel like you're still bad again to grips like one language and then you add another one on top. think
00:15:00
Alphonso Varela: yeah is I think the biggest thing to watch on that is Are we then creating the situation where people will very easily?
Alphonso Varela: Rely on having Chacha PT. because if we're making it so that the learning Curve is very steep. then are they halfway to the program just going to be transform this into dotnet, and paste stuff on there and it works and they don't understand anything. That's maybe something we need to watch out for.
Beth Azzopardi: That's already quite a lot of that already.
Alphonso Varela: yeah, yeah, but yes, I'm sure there is I mean I know there is but are we making it more? Prone to that by adding too much.
Beth Azzopardi: Yeah, I think your point about what things becoming they're being so much information that actually you're retaining and learning. very little High quality,…
Alphonso Varela: Yeah. Yeah.
Beth Azzopardi: I think that is a good point.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah, because maybe we lose a little bit of the repetition. the advantage of our program is that Right now even though people hate going to the one week programs and I do think we should make them longer. But what it has is that it's got a lot of callback. So every week you have to redo the stuff you did the previous week. Until it's second nature. So even if you start off by using chat gbt it you get the chance for it to make sense. And so if we're flipping very rapidly into a different framework. Do that. Do we lose that? But maybe in that case having the three-week projects. Is the good in between? so the projects are a bit longer,…
Dan Sofer: schedule
Alphonso Varela: but you do still have to start if half of the program.
Alphonso Varela: Two three week projects. It means that twice you have to go through that whole setup where you get a little bit of that callback.
Alphonso Varela: So that might be a good goldilock Zone essentially for us.
Ivan Gonzalez: Or some wondering when they're going to learn the fundamentals of sharp.
Ivan Gonzalez: In our application, I guess we decode words and stuff like that for JavaScript. I guess we can do something similar. But again that's adding something on top. I can't imagine that. in weeks four to six will just throw them straight into a back end without some fundamentals of other language works
Alphonso Varela: Yeah.
Beth Azzopardi: Maybe between The part-time course and the full-time. They have to do a fundamentals with I mean,…
Alphonso Varela: but how
Beth Azzopardi: I assume we will find some online resource. for them to
Dan Sofer: We're talking across. so different aspects
Dan Sofer: So first is the issue we started with which is around how long the project should be. let's just park that for a second. because we've shifted onto this topic of how intenses are going to be and what can we teach them?
Dan Sofer: I
Dan Sofer: What hasn't come up which surprises me slightly? Because in a way it looks to me like it sort of obvious, but we need to be doing typescript. And there are two reasons why we need to be doing typescript and almost everybody doing node on the back end is doing it with typescript. I mean not everybody but I would say 60 to 70% of people doing JavaScript on the back end using typescript so if we're going to teach node as a back end then. There's quite The other very good case for making typescript is if we are committed to C sharp.
Dan Sofer: you do know typescript is basically halfway between C sharp and JavaScript if you learn typescript, you've learned half of differences between JavaScript and C sharp Yes,…
Alphonso Varela: Did not know.
00:20:00
Dan Sofer: so very briefly.
Dan Sofer: typescript which you're all someone familiar with it is just JavaScript with type annotations.
Dan Sofer: C sharp Has a syntax it's descended from sea in the same way that JavaScript it does the same thing with curly braces and semicolons. So it has a sort of familiarity to it. It's a syntactical familiarity to it. it also has ivanitations and it's
Alphonso Varela: because
Dan Sofer: possibly the most important thing to get your head around with sheet C sharp. If you're coming from JavaScript just it's type annotations, which you already have with. The cript there are some other significant differences with C sharp. I mean there are some six syntactic differences and also the methods are all different other things that people need to be aware of is that
Dan Sofer: unlike JavaScript that you can write. In a oriented way with C sharp, you really are expected to write objects. In fact, it's really hard to sort of right in a pure functional style in the way you can get away with the JavaScript. You really are supposed to be thinking in terms of objects and methods all the time. so that's other significant differences are quite a few of the things that are part of JavaScript core. really simple example something like doing a console log in JavaScript. It's part of the core language. Whereas in C sharp. It's often an external Library. I mean, it's part of the core library, but it is external and You have to require it into your script before it'll work. So there are some setups you need to do in C sharp.
Dan Sofer: That you would think to do in JavaScript. And because C sharp so objects oriented it does have.
Dan Sofer: part of this object interfacing you can declare math as protect or public or private so that it has an idea of data hiding which javascript's not really bothered with some really care about certainly is called the language shops. Got it at a very kind of introductory level that's about it.
Dan Sofer: It's a bit of different syntax loads of different methods that you have to learn all the libraries but that really is not conceptually difficult the conceptually interesting stuff is going all in on object oriented, which is such useful exercise. Anyway, our apprentices are getting tripped up in their own Point assessments are not really recognizing the differences between the different paradigms. This is definitely different Paradigm and everything's an object and you have to think of it that way and everything's got to type interface, but then that's just a science typescript.
Dan Sofer: That's about it. I mean, it's really, at a bit as a beginner level I'm not talking about advanced level but a beginner level that's it. You literally can pick that up in an afternoon. It may take you three or four weeks to get used to applying it and it may take you one old two months even to get used to sort of all the library calls that you got to make and the different method names and you'll keep on forgetting when you switch between JavaScript and C sharp, you'll forget what you're supposed to name things and what the methods are called. But by that is what co-pilot is for. it can remember all that stuff.
Dan Sofer: And that's exactly what people should be using to actually PC for it's completely legitimate use, I've just changed language I forgotten which methods I'm supposed to be using help me out. But it's not a big deal moving from sharp and it's almost two equal steps. If you go JavaScript typescript and then typescript sharp in my view and this is just an introduction level just at the level of which we're dealing with things and that's my general take on it. I'll stop talking now.
Alphonso Varela: I don't know if maybe that's a bit optimistic of how fast people pick it up because for example if they are equal steps, we all move to typescript in our final project and we did our projects in typescript both our cohort and in fact 28 did that. but then when you look under the hood, there was a lot of Annie's going around because people couldn't be bothered with actually understanding typescript and actually applying it. They were just technically getting away with it. So then when you look at those projects, there's a lot of syntactic tricks that are undoing the What typescript would be bringing?
00:25:00
Alphonso Varela: so Yeah, I'm not sure. How quick I mean I like the idea because I like it for myself. I would like to be exposed to all that so I think it would be useful for them, but I don't know if in 12 weeks going through. JavaScript typescript Ctrl and learning
Alphonso Varela: Maybe we were dropping next. I don't forget now, but It feels like we would need to plan that really really well.
Beth Azzopardi: What if we?
Dan Sofer: So it was a quick question for Alphonso.
Beth Azzopardi: Sorry, Dan.
Dan Sofer: How many of you finished all three courses on execute program on typescript you reckon
Alphonso Varela: I think I'll be the only one who did.
Dan Sofer: Yeah, right. I think…
Beth Azzopardi: right
Dan Sofer: unless people are rigorous with their learning and we insist that it will be push but The program doesn't start till May. It got a whole bunch of learners. who we're working with now. We should be moving on to typescript as soon as possible and…
Beth Azzopardi: different
Dan Sofer: being really faced with them about execute program.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah, yeah, we definitely should like either way we should do that. Yes.
Beth Azzopardi: I was going to say I mean yeah, that's a really good point that both start 29a and fat 29b. Definitely have a capacity. To do a typescript project. So maybe we are.
Beth Azzopardi: Nick and Shawn to incorporate that into the continued support, but I was gonna suggest and this is just throwing it out there, but what if we bring typescript into the foundation skills boot camp
Ivan Gonzalez: .
Dan Sofer: I would very happily bring it into the foundation. However, it has to come through people completing execute program and they're not even close at the moment.
Beth Azzopardi: Yeah, I think. that
Beth Azzopardi: Comes down to a capacity issue. I really feel a lot of people Don't have the capacity. So guys that's my worry about our Reliance on execute. I totally understand that the learning and the drive to learn how to come from the learners, but this is our third time doing it now and every time people are over You don't have time to do everything. And that's cute program is the thing that falls away and even now I've got people saying, I've had one or two Learners asking me if they should be doing executable project. I have to tell them we should finish the project. Because you need to present it next week. So yeah.
Dan Sofer: That's fine. We've got the beauty of having people finishing months before the Start program is we can do lots of remedial effort.
Beth Azzopardi: Yeah.
Ivan Gonzalez: But what about going forward when it does not the case?
Dan Sofer: Going forwards for the first time. And everybody's place is contingent on actually completing the erase course.
Beth Azzopardi: Just to discuss boot camp. Yeah, I love that.
Dan Sofer: Yeah, so the way it's going now you put together a portfolio and do an interview and then you get an offer as early as we can possibly make it and you then get an offer conditional on finishing execute program.
Beth Azzopardi: I think I'm pretty good idea.
Ivan Gonzalez: we've got going to be the same for typescript and…
Dan Sofer: just erase
Ivan Gonzalez: the full-time remembers
Beth Azzopardi: we have
Dan Sofer: with what we're calling the full-time program, we need to properly call the apprenticeship program because people are coming on it unless they have an apprenticeship and obviously if the employer Fire somebody they're on doesn't matter how lazy they've been on their skin program. so We can't be quite as erce. Between the end of the skills boot camp and started the apprenticeship. but I think we can be clear with people about what they're going to need to know and be clear about how we think they should get there. And if they already have a job and they're slacking or job offer and they're slacking and…
00:30:00
Ivan Gonzalez: position
Dan Sofer: there's a amount that we can do but I think.
Dan Sofer: Personally I think we need to upgrade our emphasis on Excel program and I'm intrigued by the idea of encouraging people with typescript. even as early as The skills boot camp and I'm certainly not against that idea.
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah, and also you're not gonna do the full-time program unless you have complete typescript execute program. But then we actually let them on if you don't know it more. For sure.
Beth Azzopardi: And I think if we tell people want to get job as well. So if we tell them I know it seems obvious, but maybe if we really lean into the fact that no typescript will improve people's chances. And obscuring an apprenticeship that will probably be a good motivator as well.
Alphonso Varela: I mean what? So on here we're also.
Alphonso Varela: I mean, it's a factor. We can't really control it's difficult to count on it, but It's also very likely that once you introduce the idea of typescript. it's JavaScript with a little bit of stuff on top. It's like there's a possibility that I just start using it on their projects. To be honest, and they just start making no mistakes. straight away, so
Alphonso Varela: That could also because that's kind of what happened with us. We had one talk about typescript and then we got excited. and we just started we were using it wrong, but we started using it as soon as we could right so. maybe that is actually easier to push than we imagine.
Dan Sofer: The more I listen to us the more I think typescript sharp actually work really nicely together. what's really great about the difference between typescriptions she sharp, of course. Is in tight script you can get away without type annotations. Just a superset JavaScript.
Alphonso Varela: 
Dan Sofer: It'll pass the compiler if you don't give it.
Dan Sofer: Annotations or you can just use any and it lets it go so you can get away with lazy programming. No type checking. Have f** try that in C sharp, you won't get very far. And so you're kind of go from types kept sharp gun.
Alphonso Varela: All right.
Dan Sofer: I understand all this type annotation s*** so I can get that in C sharp and then you run it and it compiles and the compilation fails because you're being lazy and you think Sharp is a properly tight language where it's not that If I can do type annotations if I want. I absolutely bloody well have to do them. and that's a really nice. Framing of our JavaScript you just do anything you want. It's an anything goes language typescript.
Dan Sofer: I can be stricter if I want to C sharp got no choice and I think shifting between those gives people a real sense of becoming more disciplined as programmers.
Dan Sofer: And what you win what you get for that and what you lose and people then I think it'll be visceral because I know I read very good JavaScript Debs who said I've just had enough of typescript. I'm going back to JavaScript typescript's complete f* waste of time, Yeah and you hear the same thing, with testing and all sorts of things. but in any case, it'll be really nice for people. won't it be great for people while they're with us to develop taste in the languages that they use have an opinion about it. That's something almost. Nobody has when they leave families and coders now won't it be wonderful people become opinionated about the languages they use by the time they finished our training.
Alphonso Varela: So then if we go back to the other question is if we are taking those steps then where do they fit is it then a bunch of three week projects? And which ones do we introduce C sharp? where does everything fall?
00:35:00
Dan Sofer: I think it's a ladder. I think it's Ja typescript sharp. And I think…
Alphonso Varela: but
Dan Sofer: what that means is however many projects we do and by the way, I think that project that six weeks long is probably too long. But it's possible. I mean, I think we probably are moving towards three week projects, but there's a possibility.
Dan Sofer: Of two weeks might be enough in the first six weeks so that configuration may work. But in case let's assume now that it's four three week projects. If we do that, I think we can say the first three weeks is typescript with react that's fine. And then the second three weeks is C Sharp with no other differences with high introduce anything else in which in the second project because they need to get to grips with the difference between typescript and C sharp. I think anything else would be ridiculous and also Sharp comes with its own application environment.net. And so Recognizing, for example,…
Ivan Gonzalez: but
Dan Sofer: if you're doing deployment you have to create an ec2 instance. that's got.net on it rather than standard Linux distro with node.
Dan Sofer: and so all of that I think doesn't space for nothing else and then you've got the third project where maybe you can introduce next if you want to.
Dan Sofer: So and maybe even the class separates out and one goes deeper in.net and the other one. ghostly for next and the other maybe, react I mean, it's possibly I mean, I mean, I don't know that people good enough, but react in just three weeks, especially when You know that they're also getting scripture typescript. So it may be that the third project it do divide up and they specialize in a sense. I just don't know. but I'm pretty sure that project number one is typescript plus react and they should know typescript already because they've done as you program. They can focus on understanding how react works and then the second project is you're switching script and to
Alphonso Varela: But why wouldn't we just do typescript react? And then the second project go deeper in that. Where it's another three weeks where they get the grips and then we make the move to see where they've been doing type annotation. Even if there is a they're more used. Yeah.
Dan Sofer: No, you're not Alphonso. That could be right that could be right too. In fact that does sound more plausible.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah, because then it goes a bit simpler again, but it is the new language but they've been doing types. So it's probably a better transition.
Dan Sofer: Other I think we can talk to almost every.net shop and say look, we're doing JavaScript we're doing react. But this is the way we manage the transition to topnet. they learn typescript on the back end. And then they learn C sharp. I actually think I eve even a DOT net shot. they will often have full stack devs. Who expect to be able to build react components as well as the dot net but that happens and that's exactly what happened to by the way so that seems to me like a reasonable if you say to people they're going to be good at react and typescript and C sharp. I don't think anyone's going to complain with that little triangle of language and…
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah, can we just restrict the dot net stuff to the back end and…
Dan Sofer: understanding.
Ivan Gonzalez: just keep the frontend always remember?
Dan Sofer: Button is backend only.
Ivan Gonzalez: It is…
Ivan Gonzalez: but I thought there was a templating kind of.
Dan Sofer: What? JavaScript That's sorry C sharp won't run in a browser.
Ivan Gonzalez: But isn't it like a templating kind of solution?
Dan Sofer: Yeah, but that still has to be put together in the back end.
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah, but that's what I mean. maybe we can just Not to be template and just do react and it's just a pure back without.
Dan Sofer: as it happens that would suit Hackney because that's their separation. They
Ivan Gonzalez: That's what I mean. Yeah, and that's quite common. but
Alphonso Varela: I mean if they are also, for Founders encoders going forward wouldn't we want to Pander a little bit to that, if that's what they're working with. Why don't we be like this is exactly…
00:40:00
Ivan Gonzalez: 
Alphonso Varela: what we're teaching come back,
Ivan Gonzalez: And I think that would reduce the surface area of what we're teaching if we don't…
Alphonso Varela: Yeah.
Ivan Gonzalez: because templating itself can be something that you have to learn on top of everything else.
Dan Sofer: I agree in fact.
Dan Sofer: We should probably be shifting away. And in fact, with 21b Mark and I have shifted away from our Express server we're delivering Jason which is then.
Dan Sofer: I mean, it's confusing the* out of them. They're delivering Jason from the express service.
Ivan Gonzalez: Okay.
Beth Azzopardi: Dreams Come
Dan Sofer: And then manipulating it.
Dan Sofer: Using JavaScript in their browsers. and…
Ivan Gonzalez: That's cool.
Dan Sofer: we made that possible by God. Marked at a lovely job once once he and I had agreed what we were doing he went away and just wrote some templates for some boilerplate code. So this is what you'll note endpoints look like this is what your front end. Coach should look like this is where you're going to manipulate the dog. I'm very very simple stuff.
Dan Sofer: But I think yeah, I am in full agreement that we should.
Beth Azzopardi: That smiles here.
Dan Sofer: We should mandate that approach with people.
Ivan Gonzalez: I think that's not good.
Dan Sofer: No, no back-end templating. And doing nothing, but delivering Jason.
Beth Azzopardi: he
Dan Sofer: only Jason endpoints I don't think that's good. But
Alphonso Varela: But then we're still project short and also we haven't for better. Or is that the last?
Beth Azzopardi: only going up and…
Dan Sofer: but
Alphonso Varela: That's the fourth one. Okay.
Beth Azzopardi: so just to clarify is so the shift from what shot and I were posing proposing is Rather than introduce C sharpen.net in the second project. will focus on typescript And the first two and then introduce C sharp in the third project.
Dan Sofer: That's what Alphonso suggested and I think that's probably right.
Beth Azzopardi: Okay.
Beth Azzopardi: We're going to be.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah, I mean.
Ivan Gonzalez: So what it would be a react…
Beth Azzopardi: it and…
Ivan Gonzalez: then typescript then.net.
Beth Azzopardi: say of my homework,…
Alphonso Varela: It's reactant typescript twice.
Beth Azzopardi: but when you went Going to be careful you.
Alphonso Varela: I think the worry with that is that then we give them one three week project on C sharp before they go on to the text better project but I think probably the transition from what Dan is saying will make more sense. after they've done types twice
Beth Azzopardi: one of the night before you
Alphonso Varela: That's kind of.
Ivan Gonzalez: both, I think there's some background function of your
Dan Sofer: I mean there is a lot of detail missing at this point, but I think to have the overall structure.
Alphonso Varela: Yeah.
Dan Sofer: Feels like except forward.
Alphonso Varela: So I guess the question is before we go on C sharp? do we do it next at all? we do reactive typescript and then reactive typescript with next doing some background back and stuff. And then move away from that. C sharp or What's our choice here?
Beth Azzopardi: Maybe not and the next is a potential text better technology.
Alphonso Varela: Because it is quite I mean to get to grips with it. For a product owner is a bit.
Ivan Gonzalez: I'm just gonna be in my charger.
Dan Sofer: So I've got some thoughts on this a firstly take for about it.
Ivan Gonzalez: each other
Dan Sofer: We should not be introducing any new technologies. What we're introducing is a client and…
Alphonso Varela: Yeah.
Dan Sofer: that's the big conceptual leap And a product owner and they've got needs and you need to meet those needs regardless of the tech stack. And that should be the focus. So we've only really got nine weeks and to work on this. I think it's reasonable. to say the third three weeks the sort of week seven to nine are the specialization weeks and I think it's okay. If we have people that we know. Are using different Technologies?
00:45:00
Dan Sofer: And there we go. Okay, your backend is C Sharp. You're going to learn that. Hey, we have we may have A company that wants to fire a higher for apprentices and…
Ivan Gonzalez: just
Dan Sofer: they have a python backend great. we can work with that. And python is another language that I would like us to have competence with internally. I mean, obviously we do with the AI program. but I think if we to see The software developer apprenticeship as a possible Prelude to going into the AI apprenticeship. I think introducing python at some point does make some sense. I'm not stressing. We do it this time around but I'm thinking if those week seven to nine are sort of
Dan Sofer: a sort of non-core. This is where you do your options. sharp It may be an option. We ask most people to do but on the other hand if we have people who are going into apprenticeships where And they are going to be using other Technologies including next then I think we should give them the option to learn next instead of sharp.
Dan Sofer: And I think that's how it happens. That apprentices are not going to need.
Ivan Gonzalez: .
Dan Sofer: The next they just don't use it.
Ivan Gonzalez: We've got six minutes left. We have any. actions and things that we want to Divo
Alphonso Varela: I mean if we are agreeing that it's the three four week projects and one is the tech for better. We still need to know what the other three are going to be exactly, right?
Beth Azzopardi: and although I think Certainly the first one. we probably need to be a bit creative if we're doing the same project twice, but the first one I think Sean and I know thinking we can reuse the some version of a shopping. app because that uses Database this is and…
Alphonso Varela: yeah, I think that makes
Beth Azzopardi: I don't know. I just feel like you could cover quite a lot of stuff with a shopping sub website. We might need to have a little thing about the second one. Okay, because we don't want to just ask him to put the same thing twice, but I'm sure GPT can give us a response to that.
Ivan Gonzalez: So maybe a good next step is just actually to come up with the document like the one that you have Beth. Maybe just even entering on that one with what I was come out today. I mean just the proper structure set up and then we can see where there's gaps that we need to go and fill in going forward kind of thing.
Alphonso Varela: essentially if you write out projects a very brief description of…
Beth Azzopardi: it's
Alphonso Varela: what the project would be and the requirements that we would give them. build something use these Technologies, make sure this happens and this happens. and that way we can see what the program would actually look like and How much preparation we would need to put into it?
Ivan Gonzalez: Yeah, so I wonder if doing that before the next meeting and maybe circulating it around we can have a look Through it before the next meeting and then in the next meeting we can just then actually have more concrete tasks that each of us can kind of take away.
Dan Sofer: Yeah, I mean, it's worth thinking in terms of the Intel in terms of the projects and they're three week projects now, they're really meaty, right it definitely worth thinking in terms of get well known applications. So, for example. the first project could be rewriting Twitter and then the second project could be rewriting Amazon, that's the shopping cart thing. And the third project could be.
Dan Sofer: Yeah, I mean maybe something.
Dan Sofer: Maybe something more like Facebook that's got a little bit more going on. Yeah, I need to think about it but I think big consumer facing applications that we have all used. And so we all can get ourselves in the minds of the product owner quite easily.
00:50:00
Dan Sofer: Yeah, maybe some sort of review sites.
Ivan Gonzalez: right
Dan Sofer: Yeah. Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff we could do and then also we should be thinking about ways we can use interesting apis as well. I think not to be using external apis as a mistake. so Those are the projects the other thing I would say and I know we've got no time left. The other thing I would say. Is that once this We have begun to settle on a broad structure and possible projects. What I am going to want to do. is learning outcomes for all of the three
Dan Sofer: All of the three projects that we're doing in the first nine weeks on the KSP. And the idea that already was quoted that we give people a chance to think about what portfolio might look like.
Dan Sofer: and I think it's something we also be thinking about Yeah, and the ksbs I think and the learning outcomes that'll give us all the detail we need I think we'll be good to go.
Beth Azzopardi: Okay, I think that's probably we should do in terms of immediate actions. the CFS between us could come up with the Discuss what the Project's gonna look like and then once we come back with those we could do the mapping. Okay, cool Alphonso,…
Ivan Gonzalez: Okay.
Beth Azzopardi: and I can have a conversation about how we're going to split those up. This afternoon.
Alphonso Varela: Yep.
Beth Azzopardi: I actually need to rush off I can put the rest of this meeting and had out these notes as well. see you later, everyone. Thank you.
Dan Sofer: Okay.
Meeting ended after 00:52:22 👋
